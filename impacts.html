        ICT or Information Communication Technology has an essential role in
        modifying, and modernizing present day's learning and educational
        systems. Similar to Information technology, ICT is another technology
        that helps people to get access to information. ICT focuses on
        communication that includes wireless network, internet, as well as
        communication mediums. Market is filled with a wide range of ICT tools,
        that includes computing industry, electronic display, and
        telecommunications. ICT impacts our life in positive and negative ways.
        Let us know more about these effects in detail.

        <h1>POSITIVE EFFECTS OF ICT</h1>
        <h2><b>Increased access to services </b></h2>
        <p>
          The significant advantage of ICT on individuals is the expanded
          admittance to administrations, and data that has went with in the
          advancement of the Web. Instant Messaging and VoIP phones, both of
          which are cheaper and better options for communication, can be
          accessed quickly through ICT. It gives you new and exciting ways to
          have fun, have fun, build relationships, and get services and goods
          from suppliers. Online tutorials and distance learning made possible
          by this technology contribute to increased accessibility to education.
          Newer learning methods like virtual reality and interactive multimedia
          are available to the public. Versatile working, adaptable plans for
          getting work done, virtual workplaces, and so on. Aid in enhancing job
          opportunities in the communications sector for individuals.
        </p>

        <h2><b> Offer new tools and opportunities </b></h2>
        <p>
          The availability of numerous brand-new tools is the second significant
          impact of information and communication technology. In the field of
          photography, ICT offers a unique and highly innovative set of tools
          and procedures. People are able to produce impressive results by
          making use of high-quality printers, digital cameras, and photo
          editing software. As a result, these technologies have substantially
          reduced the requirement for a photographic studio. ICT additionally
          helps individuals to conquer their handicaps. Software for screen
          reading or magnification enables blind or partially sighted
          individuals to work with normal text rather than Braille.
        </p>

        <h2><b> Enhances operations of organizations </b></h2>
        <p>
          There are basically three main regions that are influenced by ICT in
          an organization: communications, security, and information management.
          <br />
          <br />
          <a><b> Communication: </b></a>
          <br />
          ICT provides technologies like VoIP are more efficient and affordable
          that other forms of commonly used communication in the organization
          such as telephone, messaging, email, and sales catalogues. VoIP allows
          people to access to large and worldwide markets easily.
          <br />
          <br />
          <a><b> Flexible Response </b></a>
          <br />
          Organizations that have implemented ICT ensures good communication.
          This implies that they can quickly and easily respond to changes. This
          technology implies improved customer relations, better supply chain
          for services, and goods, serve customers efficiently by quickly
          manufacturing new products as per their requirements etc.
          <br />
          <br />
          <a><b> Information Management </b></a>
          <br />
          Organizations greatly benefit from ICT for management of their
          information. Better stock control, less wastage, increased cash flow,
          etc. are some of the benefits realized by mangers who use ICT in their
          organization. By being constantly updated of the information, they can
          form better decisions.
          <br />
          <br />
          <a><b> Enhanced Security </b></a>
          <br />
          ICT can improve security of the data. Its encryption methods help in
          keeping data secure from people with malicious intent. This technology
          stores encryption for storing as well as sending data electronically.
          This enables commercial secrecy within the organization. ICT uses
          physical security systems to access data such as face or iris
          recognition, or fingerprint detection.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="negative">
        <h1><b> Negative Effects of ICT </b></h1>
        <h2><b> Job Loss </b></h2>
        <p>
          The loss of employment is a major side effect of ICT. This technology
          can be used to eliminate the need for human labor in commonly
          performed operations within an organization. Automation is taking the
          place of manual labor and has emerged as the sole reason for job
          losses. Some of the examples being robots that replaces people for the
          assembly of parts, a barcode scanner replaces a worker for checkout
          tasks, etc. Use of ICT leads to adverse economic consequences, social
          consequences, loss of earnings, loss of self-esteem, and status among
          people in the society.
        </p>
        <h2><b> Reduced Personal Interaction </b></h2>
        <p>
          Work from home, that is considered as a benefit of ICT, also has
          negative impact on a person. A person loses touch with people due to
          reduced social interaction. This makes him/her feel unhappy, and
          isolated.
        </p>
        <h2><b> Expensive </b></h2>
        <p>
          Cost of implementation and use of ICT is high. This technology
          requires installation of several specialized software, and hardware
          that are expensive to buy and upkeep. It requires a specialist, and
          dedicated staff to operate equipment that work on ICT technology.
        </p>
        <h2><b> Need for Heightened Security </b></h2>
        <p>
          As with ICT systems, data is stored at a centralized place on the web,
          an organization should constantly monitor internet connections and
          data for its safety from hackers, viruses, malware and other threats
          that are released every day.
