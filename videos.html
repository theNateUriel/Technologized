          The Impact of Technology on Communication
        </h3>
        <p class="techbody">
          Hailing from Portland, Oregon, and in his third and final year at
          Brentwood. Captain of debate, Grant Dillard is no stranger to sharing
          opinions or arguing them for that matter. His speech titled “the
          impact of technology on communication” explores the necessity of
          conversation while dispelling the myth that debaters can’t tear it up
          on the basketball court too. Born in Portland, Oregon, Grant made his
          way to beautiful British Columbia to become a student of Brentwood
          College. When he is not debating about contentious topics or dribbling
          a ball down a court, the 17-year-old enjoys spending time with his
          friends when he’s not busy napping. Grant has over the years perfected
          his craft in public speaking as he participated in International and
          International Debate competitions. From Athens to Yale, he has since
          been using his witty humour and sharp mind to help younger students
          with hopes of becoming skilled in the art of verbal communication.

        <p class="educbody">
          This is a TEDx Talk by Scott Widman that talks about the impact of ICT
          to Education. This talk is posing the question of how technology is
          impacting the classroom from a teacher's​ perspective and how there
          are many misconceptions about how technology impacts the learning
          environment.

          Is technology really ruining your life?
        </h3>
        <p class="ruinbody">
          It is almost impossible to avoid laptops, social media, emails, and
          smartphones. Many of these technologies were developed to help
          organise our lives, while others promise to keep us fitter and happier
          for longer. But does all this technology have unintended consequences?
          David Ellis holds a 50th Anniversary Lectureship in Psychology at
          Lancaster University and an Honorary Research Fellowship at The
          University of Lincoln. Much of his work considers how recent
          methodological developments in technology and data collection (often
          referred to as digital traces) can reveal information about
          individuals and their behaviour. He has published on these topics in
          The Lancet Public Health, the International Journal of Neural Systems,
          Computers in Human Behavior, Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social
          Networking and other journals.
