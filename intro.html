    <h1>Introduction to ICT (Information and Communications Technology)</h1>
    <p>
      Information and Communication Technology is abbreviated as ICT. It
      includes digital hardware and tools like smartphones, laptops, tablets,
      and smartboards, as well as audio-visual equipment, projectors, and other
      technologies used in business, education, information, travel, and
      development. The internet, blended learning, online learning, social
      media, cloud computing, flipped classrooms, learning management systems,
      email, and opportunities for online learning are also included. In this
      contemporary time, a ton of mediations are being made for viable learning
      of the understudies and different ideas are utilized to depict these
      intercessions for the digitization of training in types of speculation,
      reception, and utilization of more up to date Data and Correspondence
      Innovation in instructive practices and exploration. Computer Assisted
      Instructions (CAI), Computer Assisted Learning (CAL), Computer Assisted
      Language Learning (CALL), Computer Assisted Teaching (CAT), Information
      and Communication Technology (IT), Information and Communication
      Technology (ICT), Instructional Technology, Teaching Learning Technology,
      and Educational Technology, among other terms, are examples of these
      concepts. A considerable lot of these ideas are utilized conversely
      overall as a result of the nearby comprehension they have.

      ICT is a broad term that refers to any communication device or
      application, including satellite systems, radio-television, cellular,
      phone, computer, and network hardware and software, and other related
      services and applications. Berce, Lanfranco, and Vehovar (2008) define
      information and communication technology (ICT) as "a mixture of hardware
      (equipment) and software (operating system, applications, etc.)" and means
      of communication (Local Area Networks, Wide-Area Networks, Backbone
      Networks, etc.) According to Bates (2015), the term "information and
      communication technology" refers to all of the computer-based,
      software-based, or e-learning-supporting tools and equipment. As a result,
      the term "information and communication technology" is being used in this
      study to refer to both the newest technologies that are used in the
      digitalization of educational institutions and the everyday practices that
      teachers use to implement these technologies. In addition, information and
      communication technology (ICT) may refer to a variety of information
      (assignments, projects, reports), communication (e-mails, websites, online
      storage), administration (LMS, CMS, databases), and software (courseware,
      tutorials, databases, websites), as well as to devices (cell phones,
      tablets, computers, laptops, e-boards, projectors, and projectors with or
      without internet access). ICT is also defined as a tool by Wang and Woo
      (2007). "ICT can be hardware (like computers, digital cameras), software
      (like Excel, discussion forums, or both," they said. It mostly means
      various computer-based resources and tools (software) in the educational
      context.
